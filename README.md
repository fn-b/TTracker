This is an Urbit Gall App that allows users to interact with Boston Train Data.

Current Issue: The frontend for  the trip planner is done But the backend does not work yet. I have detailed the issues here: https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/forum/#!topic/dev/JYCPbkWCbe0, and will move forward when I get a response from Tlon.
